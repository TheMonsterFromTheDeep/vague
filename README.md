# vague
vague - which is supposed to be written lowercase, is an image editor written in Java. vague is meant to be user-friendly and extremely powerful. It is also built by a pixel artist, and as such is projected to have multiple functions that are extremely useful for pixel art, such as randomly coloring an area with shades of a single color and creating what shall be called procedural skins - things like characters which can programmaticaly have different skins applied to different parts of the texture.

### design
##### color scheme
vague is designed with a almost baby-blue color scheme. This is for a few reasons. First, gray is a commonly used color in pixel art. Having a strangish shade of blue as the background of a transparent image allows for use of gray colors. Blue is also a rather nice color and is friendly to work in. Of course, the theme will eventually be customizable.

##### GUI
The GUI is designed similarly to that of the 3D modeling software Blender. There is a single window split into multiple "modules," which each can be resized individually. Each module can also be changed to display any type of window, such as the image editor, a tool palette, or some sort of settings.

##### editor
The editor is definitely going to support bitmap images. However, it will also have some types of objects that can be edited or rendered irreversibly (aside from the undo function) onto the image. These types of objects include text and lines and some sorts of shapes.

vague may also eventually support vector editing.

### goals
The main goal of vague is to make a nice image editor. It will definitely support bitmap image editing, and potentially vector image editing in the future.

If everything goes well, vague may eventually support some sorts of animation.
